# ContosoDashboard-SSD

The ContosoDashboard application is intended for TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY.

The ContosoDashboard-SSD repository contains the starter code project for training that teaches Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using the GitHub Spec Kit. ContosoDashboard is a fictional application created solely for educational purposes.

- The project codebase is NOT intended for use in production environments.
- The project architecture is NOT intended as a model for production applications.
- The project is NOT actively maintained and may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities.
- The project is provided "as-is" without warranties or support of any kind.
- **The project implements mock authentication and authorization for training purposes**

## 🔒 Security Features (Training Implementation)

This application includes a **mock authentication system** designed for training without external dependencies:

- ✅ Cookie-based authentication (8-hour sliding expiration)
- ✅ Claims-based identity with user roles
- ✅ Razor Pages for login/logout (proper HTTP request handling)
- ✅ Custom authentication state provider for Blazor Server integration
- ✅ Authorization enforcement on all protected pages (`[Authorize]` attribute)
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- ✅ Service-level security to prevent unauthorized data access
- ✅ IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) protection
- ✅ Defense in depth (middleware, page attributes, service checks)
- ✅ Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- ✅ Cookie security with sliding expiration
- ✅ User isolation - each user sees only their authorized data
- ✅ No external services required (suitable for offline training)

**Note**: The mock authentication is suitable for training only. Production deployments require proper identity providers with password hashing, MFA, OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, and compliance with security standards (WCAG 2.1, TLS encryption, audit logging).

### Mock Login System

**Available Users** (no password required - select from dropdown):

| Display Name | Email | Role | Department |
|-------------|-------|------|------------|
| System Administrator | `admin@contoso.com` | Administrator | IT |
| Camille Nicole | `camille.nicole@contoso.com` | Project Manager | Engineering |
| Floris Kregel | `floris.kregel@contoso.com` | Team Lead | Engineering |
| Ni Kang | `ni.kang@contoso.com` | Employee | Engineering |

**Login Process:**

1. Navigate to `/login` (automatic redirect if not authenticated)
2. Select a user from the dropdown
3. Click "Login" - you'll be redirected to the dashboard as that user

⚠️ **Important:** This mock authentication system is for **training only**. Production applications should use Azure AD, Identity Server, Auth0, or similar identity providers with proper password hashing, MFA, and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect.

## Configuration

### Database Connection

The default connection string in `appsettings.json` uses SQL Server LocalDB:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ContosoDashboard;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
```

Update this if using a different SQL Server instance.

### Production Authentication Guidance

This training application uses mock authentication. For production applications, you would need to:

- Implement proper identity providers (Azure AD, Identity Server, Auth0)
- Add password hashing and salting (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2)
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Implement OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols
- Add rate limiting and account lockout policies
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Use secure session management with idle timeouts
- Implement password complexity requirements and rotation policies

See [Microsoft's ASP.NET Core Security documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/) for production implementation guidance.

### User Roles

The application supports four role levels with hierarchical permissions:

- **Employee**: View and update assigned tasks, view projects where member, manage own profile
- **TeamLead**: All Employee permissions plus view team member activities
- **ProjectManager**: All TeamLead permissions plus create/manage projects, assign tasks
- **Administrator**: Full system access including all administrative functions

## Sample Data

The application includes pre-seeded data for testing:

**Users** (all available for mock login):

- `admin@contoso.com` - System Administrator (Administrator role)
- `camille.nicole@contoso.com` - Camille Nicole (Project Manager role)
- `floris.kregel@contoso.com` - Floris Kregel (Team Lead role)
- `ni.kang@contoso.com` - Ni Kang (Employee role)

**Project**:

- "ContosoDashboard Development" with 3 sample tasks in various states

## Application Pages

| Page | Route | Description | Auth Required |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Login | `/login` | User selection for mock auth | No |
| Dashboard | `/` | Summary, announcements, quick actions | Yes |
| Tasks | `/tasks` | View and manage your tasks | Yes |
| Projects | `/projects` | View your projects | Yes |
| Project Details | `/projects/{id}` | Detailed project view | Yes (member only) |
| Team | `/team` | View team members | Yes |
| Notifications | `/notifications` | Manage notifications | Yes |
| Profile | `/profile` | Edit your profile | Yes |
| Logout | `/logout` | End session and clear cookies | Yes |

## Key Functionalities

### Dashboard (Home Page)

- Summary cards with real-time metrics
- Active announcements display
- Quick action links
- Recent notifications feed

### Task Management

- Filter by status, priority, and project
- Quick status updates via dropdown
- Priority-based color coding
- Overdue task highlighting

### Project Management

- Project cards with progress bars
- Completion percentage calculation
- Team member visibility
- Status badges

### User Profile

- Profile information editing
- Availability status management
- Notification preferences
- Display initials when no photo is set

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Login

- Ensure database is created (run `dotnet run` to auto-create)
- Check that seeded users exist in database
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Redirected to Login After Login

- Check browser cookies are enabled
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private mode

### Can't Access a Page

- Verify you're logged in (user name shown in top-right)
- Check if your role has permission for that resource
- Verify you're a member of the project/task you're trying to access

### Database Issues

**Option 1: Recreate via LocalDB**

```powershell
sqllocaldb stop mssqllocaldb
sqllocaldb delete mssqllocaldb
# Then run the application - database will be recreated automatically
```

**Option 2: Using EF Tools**

- Delete database: `dotnet ef database drop --force`
- Recreate: Run application (auto-creates with seed data)

**Note**: The application uses `EnsureCreated()` for development, so just running `dotnet run` will automatically create and seed the database if it doesn't exist.

## Learning Objectives

This training application teaches:

1. **Authentication Patterns** - How to implement and configure authentication
2. **Authorization Enforcement** - Using attributes and policies
3. **Claims-Based Identity** - Working with user claims
4. **IDOR Prevention** - Service-level authorization checks
5. **Security Best Practices** - Defense in depth, least privilege
6. **ASP.NET Core Security** - Industry-standard patterns and middleware

## Using This Application for Training

### For Instructors

This application is designed to teach Spec-Driven Development and security best practices:

- Students can explore a working authentication system without cloud dependencies
- All security features are self-contained and can run offline
- Each user has different permissions to demonstrate RBAC in action
- Code includes authorization patterns students can examine and modify
- Database automatically seeds with test data for immediate hands-on practice

### For Students

Recommended learning path:

1. **Explore the UI**: Login as different users to see role-based access control
2. **Review the code**: Examine the `Services/` folder for authorization patterns
3. **Test security**: Execute the security test scenarios in this README
4. **Understand patterns**: Study how `[Authorize]` attributes work with service-level checks
5. **Experiment**: Try modifying authorization rules to understand the security model
6. **Break things**: Intentionally remove security checks to see what vulnerabilities emerge

### Discussion Topics

- Why is service-level authorization necessary in addition to page-level authorization?
- How does claims-based identity differ from session-based authentication?
- What are the security implications of the mock authentication system?
- How would you modify this application to use a real identity provider?

## Known Limitations (Training Context)

This is a **training application**, not production code. Known limitations include:

- **Mock authentication**: No real passwords - anyone can select any user account
- **No rate limiting**: Vulnerable to brute force attacks and denial of service
- **No audit logging**: Security events (login, failed auth, data changes) are not logged
- **Simplified input validation**: Production apps need more comprehensive validation
- **No session timeout warnings**: Users aren't warned before session expiration
- **CSP includes unsafe directives**: `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` required for Blazor Server but not ideal for security
- **No email verification**: User emails are not validated
- **No account lockout**: Failed login attempts don't trigger account locks

These limitations are **intentional** for training purposes to keep the application simple and self-contained. Production applications must address all of these security concerns.

## Code Quality Features

The application demonstrates good coding practices:

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields for performance
- Async/await pattern throughout for non-blocking operations
- Entity Framework Core with eager loading (`.Include()`) to prevent N+1 query problems
- Clean separation of concerns (Models, Services, Data, Pages)
- Dependency injection for loose coupling and testability
